                                <p>Please read these Terms carefully because they are a binding agreement between You
                                    and CB Resource, Inc., (&ldquo;CBR&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rdquo;).</p>
                                <p>These Terms govern your use of the websites that link to these Terms. In these Terms,
                                    the word &ldquo;Sites&rdquo; refers to each of these websites and the services
                                    offered on those Sites. You automatically agree to these Terms and to our Privacy
                                    Statement simply by using or logging into the Sites.</p>
                                <p>CBR offers multiple products and services. Your use of CBR products or services are
                                    provided by CBR pursuant to a separate manually or electronically-executed agreement
                                    with CBR or pursuant to a separate agreement with Finance 500, Inc., or another
                                    third-party. Those additional terms become part of your agreement with us, if you
                                    use the services or log into the Sites.</p>
                                <p><strong>A. Your Accounts</strong></p>
                                <p>You may be required to create an account and specify a password in order to use
                                    certain services or features on the Sites. To create an account, you must be at
                                    least 18 years old and you must provide truthful and accurate information about
                                    yourself. You agree not to impersonate anyone else when you create your account. If
                                    your information changes at any time, update your account to reflect those changes.
                                </p>
                                <p>In some cases, an account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your
                                    employer, a CBR partner organization, or an educational institution. If you are
                                    using or logging into an account assigned to you by an administrator, additional
                                    terms may apply to your use of the Sites. Moreover, your administrator may be able
                                    to access or disable your account without CBR involvement.</p>
                                <p>You may not share your account with anyone else. You agree to keep your password
                                    confidential, and try not to use it on other websites. If you believe that your
                                    account has been compromised at any time, immediately notify your system
                                    administrator.</p>
                                <p>You agree to notify CBR immediately of any unauthorized use or any other breach of
                                    security involving your username and password or account. CBR will not be liable for
                                    any loss incurred as a result of an unauthorized use of a username/password or
                                    account.</p>

                                    For example, we may add or remove functionality or features, and we may suspend or

                                    rights are necessary in order for CBR to offer its Services. This license continues
